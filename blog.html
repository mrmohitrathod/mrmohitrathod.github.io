So today's article is something special, we are going to tell you about a very special place which is kind of different in its own. When everybody is busy visiting famous places, high end restaurants, this place is missing its spotlight so we thought to let you know about this lovely place the Jail Bhajiya House. They serve delicious hot Methi Gotas, Mirchi and Onion Bhajiyas and Aloo Gotas.</p>
			<p><h2><b>What Makes It Special</b></h2></p>
			<p>As you have got it from the name the Jail Bhajiya House stands special on its own, the endless hours of work, efforts, dedication and love can change an individuals life story (comes with lot's handwork and day dedication). The Bhajiya House is located near RTO Ahmedabad and it was established back in 1998 and all kinds of bhajiyas are made by the Jail Inmates. If you want to see a crowd of Amdavadis we suggest you go there in weekend mornings, this place would be full of people we tell you. it's been 20 years but the place remains the same and special for amdavadis. So the 20 years of glory, love and happiness of the place makes it special.</p>

			<p><h2><b>Whole Day Schedule</b></h2></p>
			<p>The Jail Inmates wake up early in the morning to start the show. To be the part of the Jail Bhajiya House team is a difficult task. They are selected by their own process of the Jail Authorities. They work really hard to serve the tasty hot Bhajiyas everyday. Jail Inmates divided into three teams which changes every month and they are also geting fair reimbursement according to their work and skills. The team works according to their daily schedule which is pre-decided.</p>

When we asked one of the inmates about the preparation he said all the inmates who are involve in it work on the routine schedule. They work hard to do it perfectly with no interruption in the process while maintaining the quality of bhajiyas, he also added that all the inmates are friendly to each other and Bhajiya House is build on trust and hard work which remains same for more than 20 years.</p>
